# Route

A simple file tree based api router for node based application.

### Motivation

I'm one of the many people who use [Next.js(Vercel)](https:github.com/vercel/next.js) and while the whole framework is great, I really like the API routes mechanism and thought I'd implement my own to avoid having to bundle the whole monolith. Thus, reducing the size of the overall application. And also to learn how this stuff works. (I'm curious like that).

### Roadmap (as of now)

-   [ ] Start of simple with something that can handle static routes.
-   [ ] Add Dynamic paths and parameter parsing.
-   [ ] Add extensive middleware support
-   [ ] Ability to compile each api file with all it's requirements

That's all I want the route to do for now.

### Contribute

As every open source project, you are free to contribute and since I'll try to achieve this without actually looking at next.js's internal code or even use @zeit/micro. The project while move slowly.
